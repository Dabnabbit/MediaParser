<current_state>
Phase 1 planning is COMPLETE. 5 plans exist and are ready for execution.

User ran `/gsd:plan-phase 1` but plans already existed from a previous session.
Claude was asking whether to view plans, replan, or proceed to execution when
user paused work.
</current_state>

<completed_work>
- CONTEXT.md: Created via /gsd:discuss-phase
- RESEARCH.md: Research completed (Flask + Celery architecture, SQLite, etc.)
- 5 PLAN.md files: All created and ready
  - 01-01-PLAN.md: Database schema
  - 01-02-PLAN.md: Job queue setup
  - 01-03-PLAN.md: File storage structure
  - 01-04-PLAN.md: CLI refactoring
  - 01-05-PLAN.md: Configuration management
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
- Execute Phase 1 plans (all 5)
- No tasks have been started yet
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
- Flask + Celery architecture (from research)
- SQLite for v1 database
- Huey job queue (lightweight alternative to Celery)
- Copy-first file handling (never modify originals)
- All infrastructure decisions deferred to Claude's discretion per CONTEXT.md
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None - ready to execute
</blockers>

<context>
Phase 1 is the foundation that all subsequent phases build on:
- Database schema for file metadata, jobs, decisions
- Job queue for background processing
- File storage structure
- Refactored CLI (from monolithic PhotoTimeFixer.py)
- Configuration system (fix hardcoded paths/timezone)

The project transforms family media from chaos to organized archive.
Architecture: Flask web app + Celery/Huey workers + Redis + SQLite.
</context>

<next_action>
Run: `/gsd:execute-phase 1`

This will execute all 5 plans in wave order, creating the foundation
infrastructure for the MediaParser project.
